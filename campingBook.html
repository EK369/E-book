                        </div>

                        <div class="text1">
                              A camping outfit should be light and compact with all unnecessary articles eliminated and all needful ones included. That reads a little funny, but it is the gist of the whole question and the biggest question that was ever presented to a man. That is, you will think so when you are trying to get a 100-pound outfit over a swampy carry on a rainy day and while laying up over a spell of wet weather afterward. In the first place, you wonder why you brought so much truck, and in the second place, why you did not bring many other things.<br><br> - So it seems needless to say that the composition of an outfit depends, to some extent, on the individual taste of the camper, and more upon the character of the trip.
                  
                              No sane man would carry the same amount of “duffle” on a walking trip that he would if he went with a team, or if he was to be in a permanent camp during the whole of his trip. Hence, I propose to classify them into two sorts—walking trips and permanent camps. But before I set down the list of impedimenta I want to moralize a little.<br><br>
                  
                              - The fry pan is an important part of the outfit, but not the most important. In it may be cooked the entire food for the party—meat, fish, bread and even the coffee. But look out that it is of a convenient pattern for transportation. 
                              
                              <br> <br>- Get a ten-inch thin iron pan, with a socket on one side for a temporary handle, or have the handle entirely removed, and fit it with a portable handle to screw to the side. This detachable handle may be used to lift any dish from the fire.

                                 The stomach of the camper will stand many severe strains, but it will finally rebel if treated to too much grease. Use as little of this lubricant as possible, and you will be surprised at the small quantity needed.<br><br><br>

                           One of the foremost considerations which confronts the camper is shelter; for upon it depends, to a large extent, his health and comfort. Of course, the character of this shelter depends upon many things: individual preference, location of the camp and facilities for transportation. <br>

                     <div class="text1">
                        Now, so far as a substitute for a comfortable tent is concerned, there is a wide range for choice. When traveling rapidly on foot, with as little impedimenta as possible, a simple square canvas, furnished with loops at two sides and large enough to shelter a man, will amply suffice. When the time arrives to make camp a(27) pole is lashed across two trees or supported on crotched sticks, the canvas is thrown across it and pinned down by the side loops and the camp is ready. If you wish to shut up one end cut some evergreen boughs and stick them thickly in the ground at that end; this will break the wind. Build your camp fire in front of the opened end and you will be comfortable.  <br>

                     <br>

                        If you desire to travel lighter still, or are caught in the woods without shelter, a few minutes’ work will suffice to build a “lean-to.” To erect this structure find two trees about four to(28) six feet apart, or drive two poles into the ground. Lash another pole across them about five feet from the ground for a ridge pole. 
                        <br><br>- Cut five poles about eight feet long and lay across this, with one end resting on the ground to form the roof. Cover these poles with bark, laid shingle fashion, or with a thick layer of evergreen boughs. It is astonishing how heavy a rain a bough roof(29) will shed if properly laid on. Now stick some poles at the two sides, with the tops lashed to the side roof poles, wattle in some brush and you have a camp that will keep you dry and with a good fire in front will be as warm as a log house, for the heat of the fire is all reflected down by the slanting roof.

                        <br>

                        If you have no time for so elaborate a construction, cut a pole, rest one end in the crotch of a tree, the other on the ground. With this for a ridge pole lean up poles and brush on each side till you have room for your shelter. If you have no axe to cut a pole, find a leaning tree or a fallen log, or even a boulder, and pile brush against it, having first thrown down a lot of boughs for a bed. This sort of a structure is capable of infinite variation.  <br>


                        <br>

- Cut straight logs about 8 inches in diameter. Nine logs 11 feet long for the back; three logs 11 feet long, and sixteen logs 4 feet long for the front; eighteen logs 9 feet long for the ends.<br><br>

- Clear a level place free from brush and lay two 11-foot and two 9-foot logs on the ground in the form of a square, with the ends of the logs notched to hold them in place, with notches deep enough so that the next log when similarly fitted will lie snugly on top. Now proceed to pile the logs up like a cob-house, notching each log at the corners and using the long logs for the back and two of the short logs for the front to provide for a door in the center, where the ends of the logs should be held by a pole on each side. When the short logs are used up put on the long ones. The logs of the front and back should be laid with the butt and top alternated to keep them level, but the ends of the camp should have the butts all laid toward the front to form the pitch of the roof and those with the greatest taper should be selected for the ends.

                     </div>

                     <div class="text1">
                        - In preparing for camp, one of the most important questions to be settled is the choice of companions. Nowhere will human nature be developed as in the camp, where quarters are limited and when there is no opportunity to get out of the way and stamp down “that ugly feeling” that the best of us have at times. If a man is a gentleman he keeps his coat on and it bothers no one but his own conscience; but a surly grumbler, a gourmand who must have just what he wants to eat, irrespective of how much trouble it may make, or a selfish, lazy man, will disturb the feelings of all the rest.<br><br>

- And a word of advice here. Constitute one man, the best-posted and most equal-tempered man in the party, as captain; and when a man makes himself obnoxious and will not be reasoned with, let the captain call assistance, if(34) necessary, and either cool him off in the nearest lake or quietly escort him to the nearest point of embarkation and bid him a long farewell; at all events, remember next year that he is not eligible for membership.  <br>

                        <br>
 It is a good idea to have a low place in front wide enough to set on the fry pan, and high enough so(39) that you may haul the live coals between them. This will save you holding the pan in your hand all the time you are using it.

One of the most important points to be considered is, What means shall we employ to insure our fish being in good condition on our arrival at camp or at the point where the catch is to be cleaned.  <br><br>

- The angler who fishes the stream can, of course, only put his fish in the creel, but if the sun is bright, a layer of damp moss will prevent(45) the fish from drying, which is of the utmost importance. But to the boat fisher the ensuing remarks are of salient value.

But to the boat fisher the ensuing remarks are of salient value. It has been my experience that if the boat used has not a fish-well built in it, it is best to use an open-mouthed knit fish bag, made of extra heavy cotton cord with an inch mesh, which can be hung over the shady side of the boat, thereby keeping the fish in their native element, and generally alive for a long time, away from the sun. This is of the utmost importance, as the sun has a very detrimental(46) effect on the fish, oftentimes softening them so that dressing them in a presentable or skillful manner is out of the question. The result of this is generally more bones in the frying pan than fish.  <br>

                        We have now arrived at the point where the fish, after having furnished sport for the angler, are of no use until some of the party displays his skill with the knife, and the speed and results exhibited by one who will take pains to render himself thoroughly conversant with the following instructions will be a revelation to the man who spends an hour in cleaning a dozen fish for his supper.

After landing, the first question often asked is, “Who has a knife?” and everybody pulls one out, ranging from a penknife to an 8-inch hunting knife, neither of which, in my mind, is worth a last year’s bird’s nest, for reasons which we have not here space to explain. After trying all shapes, kinds and sizes, I for my own use prefer the shape shown in the cut.

- This may be made out of a good pocket knife, by breaking its back and fitting a hardwood strip in slot for blade and winding the entire handle with strong twine.

The advantage in the blade being at an angle is in its tendency to always cut deeper into the flesh, instead of coming out of the cut, thereby enabling the user to make long, clean cuts down each side of the dorsal fin, which can then be removed entirely, leaving none of the annoying small bones to cause an inelegant flow of language on the part of the hungry sportsman and numerous cuts on thumb and forefinger.

                        This subject was not forgotten in the design of this little camp companion, but the danger from the administration of drugs by incompetent hands is great, and the author felt that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and something that should be avoided. The author still advises that a physician be consulted, if it be possible, not only on account of the danger of taking a wrong medicine or too much of a proper one, but because few people are really competent to make a proper diagnosis. <br>

                        Simple cuts sometimes become inflamed, and should, then, be kept wet with cold water bandages. If a disinfectant is needed, Seiler’s Antiseptic Tablets are preferable to either Carbolic Acid or Corrosive Sublimate, both of which are exceedingly dangerous.
